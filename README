findimg.py
jaggz.h is at gmail.com

Keras w/Theano deep neural network to search your plethora of images
for particular classes of images (like, those with smiles, or with objects
in them).

Features (aka problems!)
  1. It uses a classification/categorization net, not an object recognition setup.
  2. It uses a list of all your images (so you can prune it if you want).
     See section "Starting:", below.
  3. It caches 64x64 pixel versions of all your images in the cache/ folder.
     The same folder is used for your global set of images, as well as your
     cached 'thumbnails' for your training data, so it can get messy.
     findimg.py has "indim = 64", which you can change.
  4. The net convolves down several times, then uses a fully-connected layer.
     This happens to allow more leniency with the convolutions, so you don't
     need to be so precise with the dimensions of the conv2d outputs.
  5. You do need to make some subdirs in imgdat/labeled/ (see below),
     and throw a bunch of samples.  I have, for instance:
       imgdat/labeled/wife-and-i
       imgdat/labeled/wife-smiling
       imgdat/labeled/ignore-me-im-false-positive
  6. The global list of all non-labeled images is:
     dat/globfiles.txt (Again, see Starting: 1. below)
     It has thousands of entries like:
       /home/me/photos/canon rebel/2017-02-12/DCIM/0001.jpg
       /home/me/photos/canon rebel/2017-02-12/DCIM/0002.jpg
       /home/me/photos/android phone/2017-02-25/Camera/dsc-00008.jpg
       /home/me/photos/android phone/2017-02-25/Camera/dsc-00009.jpg
       ...
  7. The labeled dirs, being traversed (not a generated list.txt), uses
     a pattern to search for files by extension.
	 findimg.py has prog = re.compile('\.(jpg|gif|tif|tiff|png|bmp)$', re.IGNORECASE)

Starting:
1. Create global set of images:
   You need to create dat/globfiles.txt
   It's a list of all images in your global dataset
   Ex: find /path/to/images -iname '*.jpg' > dat/globfiles.txt
2. Make folders of special labeled categories:
   Ex's: imgdat/labeled/dogs
         imgdat/labeled/frontdoors
   Labeled folders are traversed, of any depth, but just the main subdir
   is used as the label.
